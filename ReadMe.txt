To run the command:

java -jar Gscaler.jar inputgraph outputdir scaled_edgesize scaled_nodesize

For example, your original graph edge list is myGraph.txt.
You want to scale to a graph with 100 nodes and 200 edges, and output to the dir myScaling

Then, the command is 

java -jar Gscaler.jar myGraph.txt myScaling/ 200 100
